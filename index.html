	<h1>About me:</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am a quantitative researcher working in the fixed income electronic trading group of HSBC, USA. </p>
	<p>Before that, I obtained my PhD degree in the Center for Atmosphere Ocean Science, Courant Institute, NYU. During my PhD, I was very fortunate to have Prof. Oliver BÃ¼hler and Prof. Shafer Smith as my PhD advisors. I am broadly intersted in fluid mechanics, especially geophysical fluid dynamics, and applied mathematics. My PhD thesis is aimed at understanding internal wave energy spectra in the ocean and interaction between internal waves and the large scale oceanic flows.</p>
