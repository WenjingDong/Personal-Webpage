	<h1>About me:</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am a quantitative researcher working in the fixed income electronic trading group of HSBC,USA. </p>
	<p>Before that, I finished my PhD degree in the Center for Atmosphere Ocean Science, Courant Institute, NYU. During my PhD, I was very fortunate to have Prof. Oliver BÃ¼hler and Prof. Shafer Smith as my PhD advisors. I am broadly intersted in fluid mechanics and applying mathematics to understand physical phenomena. My PhD thesis is aimed at understanding the wave energy spectrum in the ocean and interaction of waves with the large scale oceanic flows.</p>
