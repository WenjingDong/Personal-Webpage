	<h1>Wenjing Dong</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am a second year Ph.D. student in Center for Atmosphere Ocean Science, Courant Institute, NYU. My advisors are Oliver Buhler and Shafer Smith.</p>
	
	<h1>Research interests</h1>
	<p>I am broadly intersted in fluid mechanics and applying mathematics to understand physical phenomena. I am currently working on internal wave induced particle transport. In the past, I have worked on mixing in stratified fluids and numerical simulation of water waves induced by landslide.</p>
