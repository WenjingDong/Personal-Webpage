	<h1>About me:</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am a third year Ph.D. student in the Center for Atmosphere Ocean Science, Courant Institute, NYU. My advisors are Oliver BÃ¼hler and Shafer Smith. I am broadly intersted in fluid mechanics and applying mathematics to understand physical phenomena. I am currently working on Lagrangian transport in inertia-gravity waves. </p>
