	<h1>Wenjing Dong</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am a second year Ph.D. student in Center for Atmosphere Ocean Science, Courant Institute, NYU. My advisors are Oliver Buhler and Shafer Smith.</p>
	
	<h1>Research</h1>
	<p>I am broadly intersted in fluid mechanics and applying mathematics to understand physical phenomena. I am currently working on internal wave induced particle transport. In the past, I have worked on mixing in stratified fluids and numerical simulation of water waves induced by landslide.</p>
	
	<h1>Conferences</h1>
	<p><ul>
		<li>Wenjing Dong, Mona Rahmani, and Gregory Lawrence <i>"The effect of vortex pairing and Prandtl number on mixing
in moderate Reynolds number stratified flows"</i>, VIIIth International Symposium on Stratified Fluids, 2016, San Diego, California, USA.</li>
		<li>Wenjing Dong, Edmund Tedford, Mona Rahmani, and Gregory Lawrence <i>"The effects of initial perturbations on voretx pairing and mixng"</i>, 2018 Ocean Sciences Meeting, Portland, Oregon, USA.</li>
	</ul></p>
	
	<h1>Education</h1>
	<p><ul>
		<li>2017-now: Ph.D. in Math and Atmosphre Ocean Science, Courant Institue, NYU</li>
		<li>2015-2017: MASc. in Civil Engineering, University of British Columbia</li>
		<li>2011-2015: B.Eng. in Hydraulic Engineering, Tsinghua University</li>
